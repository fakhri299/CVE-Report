Self Assesment

The project I worked on involved developing a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) processing tool using Python. The program offers a user-friendly interface for retrieving and processing data on CVEs, producing reports in different file types (PDF, DOCX, TXT), and opening pertinent online browser references. 

I worked with the team to integrate various components, as well as to code certain functionality and make sure user input was handled correctly.

The application's key features, which include retrieving CVE information from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), locating relevant exploit URLs, and creating reports in the user's choice format (PDF, DOCX, or TXT).Â To access further references, I also included browser opening functionality.

We divided the work into different parts for each team member to focus on, such as GUI design, data retrieval, report production, and error management. Regular meetings and code reviews allowed for smooth collaboration and guaranteed that our code worked together.
