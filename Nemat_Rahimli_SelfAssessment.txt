Peer Review

The member has been actively participating in the project from the start, offering valuable insights into web scraping and report generation. They've always been proactive in providing constructive feedback during team meetings, helping us identify strengths and weaknesses in our current approach. Their detailed reviews on pull requests and active engagement during code discussions have led to a more robust and efficient application. Therefore, I would rate their contribution as extremely valuable to the project.


Self-Assessment:

Summary of Contributions:

I participated in development of multiple core functionalities in our CVE information processing tool, such as scraping modules (nvd_cve.py), UI/UX (main.py), and report generation (reporter.py). I implemented the back-end logic for searching and retrieving data from reliable sources like the NVD and MITRE databases. I was also responsible for writing the code for user interaction and generating reports in multiple formats, which aligns perfectly with our project objectives.

What I Learned:

Throughout this project, I gained extensive knowledge in web scraping, multithreading, Tkinter-based UI development, and document generation. I learned the nuances of using libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium and got hands-on experience in generating reports in PDF, DOCX, and TXT formats.

Team Collaboration:

I worked closely with my team members, dividing the work effectively among us and keeping each other updated on our progress. I took feedback seriously, leading to multiple iterations and improvements of the project.
Individual Code Review

Our code contribution spans various critical aspects of the project, from data retrieval to user interface design and report generation. We employed effective web scraping techniques and regular expressions to extract the required data. We also implemented multithreading to enhance the application's performance. All these contributions directly align with our project's goals of making CVE data easily accessible and understandable.
